Simple time table app made with Flutter!

## Current Status
The app has been submitted to the play store and is awaiting review.

## Implemented

 - Add and remove timetable entries. 
 - Select color of each entry.
 - Sort entries by time

## Upcoming

 - Edit entries on tap
 - Hero animations
 
## Database

 - Local SQFlite (using [Moor flutter package](https://pub.dev/packages/moor_flutter)) 

## Possible improvements

 - Replace Moor flutter package with [Hive flutter package](https://pub.dev/packages/hive). Much faster and suited for this use case.
